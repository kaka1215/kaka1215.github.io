## Adaptive Step-Size Decentralized Federated Learning Algorithm  
Undergraduate Thesis | Jan 2025 – Jun 2025  

- Developed a decentralized optimization algorithm that dynamically adjusts step sizes using local gradient information.  
- Designed a method combining gradient momentum, gradient differencing, and second-order estimation.  
- Extended the algorithm to a fully decentralized federated learning framework with dedicated communication and synchronization mechanisms.  
- Improved convergence efficiency while reducing communication overhead in distributed systems.

## Uncertainty-Aware Knowledge Graph Enhanced Legal Pre-trained Language Models  
Knowledge Graph Laboratory, Southeast University | Sep 2023 – Oct 2024  

- Focused on multi-defendant legal judgment prediction with uncertainty-aware knowledge graphs.  
- Reproduced major models such as BERT, BART, mT5, Transformer, Lawformer, GPT-2, and GPT-3.  
- Proposed a structure-aware encoder for defendant behaviors and legal premises.  
- Introduced a stepwise distillation mechanism to enhance reasoning, significantly improving prediction accuracy.  
- Patent: *A Multi-hop Commonsense Generation Method Based on Structure Awareness and Stepwise Distillation*.
